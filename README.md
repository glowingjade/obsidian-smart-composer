Everytime we ask ChatGPT, we need to put so much context information for each query. Why spend time putting background infos that are already in your vault?

**Obsidian Smart Composer is a plugin that helps you write efficiently with AI by easily referencing your vault content.** Inspired by Cursor AI and ChatGPT Canvas, this plugin unifies your note-taking and content creation process within Obsidian.

## Features

### Contextual Chat

> Upgrade your note-taking experience with our Contextual AI Assistant, inspired by Cursor AI. Unlike typical AI plugins, our assistant allows you to **precisely select the context for your conversation.**

- Type `@<fname>` to choose specific files/folders as your conversation context
- Get responses based on selected vault content

#### Multimedia Context

Now, you can **add website links** as additional context for your queries.

- Coming soon: Support for image, and external files (PDF, DOCX, ...)

### Apply Edit

> Smart Composer **suggests edits to your document.** You can apply with a single click.

- Offers document change recommendations
- Apply suggested changes instantly

Note: The Apply Edit feature is currently slower than desired. We are working on improvements in future updates.

### Vault Search (RAG)

> **Automatically find and use relevant notes** from your vault to enhance AI responses.

- Hit `Cmd+Shift+Enter` to run Vault Search answer
- Semantic search across your vault to find the most relevant context

#### Additional Features

- **Custom Model Selection** : Use your own model by setting your API Key (stored locally).
